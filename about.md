Machine Learning (ML) systems can make outcome and diagnosis predictions that have the same level of performance as expert clinicians in some domains. However, the success of these systems has been mainly limited to cases where large amount of clearly labelled data is available. In order to expand this success to other areas, the use of data sources with higher uncertainty and subjectivity should be investigated. In this regard, Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are a potentially important data source for ML. A PROM is a questionnaire that aims to measure patient status and outcomes based on multiple questions filled in by the patient. Measurement uncertainty of PROMs can be affected by the cognitive and psychological state of the patient. Repetitive collection of multiple PROMs offers a useful resource to track the patient status over time, but this can also increase measurement uncertainty as it requires increased cognitive load and effort from the patient.

This project focuses on using PROMs for ML and decision support tools. The project aims to develop a systematic approach to build probabilistic programming and Bayes network models based on PROMs. These probabilistic PROM models will enable more efficient collection of PROMs as they will be able to deal with missing inputs, select questions specific to the patient’s condition and their previous answers, and stop asking questions when sufficient information is acquired. Probabilistic PROM models will offer a modular structure based on the Object-Oriented Bayesian Network paradigm. This enables them to be integrated as a part of more complex ML and decision-making models. Tools and techniques developed in this project will be applied to and evaluated by PROMS that are routinely used by the international and interdisciplinary project partners. A user interface prototype will be developed to enable a wider use of PROM BN models in digital environments. This project will help Principal Investigator (PI) establish a career path in ML with uncertain and subjective data that are prone to cognitive factors. Project will develop international and interdisciplinary academic collaborations for the PI and his institution.
